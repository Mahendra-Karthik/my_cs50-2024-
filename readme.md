# Online Examination System

#### Video Demo: [URL HERE]

#### Description:

The **Online Examination System** is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of conducting exams and evaluating results. The system allows students to register, log in, take exams, and view their results. Administrators (Examiners) can create and manage exam questions, upload question banks in bulk via CSV files, and view the results of all students. This system provides a user-friendly interface and a secure environment for both examiners and students.

### Features:
1. **User Registration and Authentication**:
   - Users can register as students or examiners (admins).
   - Examiners must enter a secret password (`examiner@123`) to register successfully as an administrator. If the wrong password is provided, registration fails, ensuring that only authorized users can create exams.
   - The system uses `Flask-Login` to manage user sessions and authentication.
   
2. **Exam Creation and Management**:
   - Examiners can manually add individual questions through a form or bulk upload questions using a CSV file. The uploaded questions are stored in the database.
   - Exam questions are pulled from the question bank and randomized for each user taking the exam to prevent cheating.

3. **Exam-Taking Process**:
   - Students can log in, take the exam, and submit their answers. The answers are then graded by the system automatically using a helper function that compares the user's responses with the correct answers stored in the database.
   
4. **Results and Grading**:
   - After completing the exam, students can immediately view their score.
   - Examiners have access to view the results of all students through a dedicated admin interface, which provides insights into exam performance across users.

5. **Database Management**:
   - The system uses `SQLite` as the database, storing user information, exam questions, and exam results.
   - Tables such as `User`, `Question`, and `ExamResult` manage all relevant data, ensuring scalability and ease of management.

### Files in the Project:

- **app.py**:  
  This is the core of the Flask application that defines all the routes and logic. It handles user authentication, exam generation, and result viewing. It also provides admin functionality for examiners to manage questions and upload files.

- **config.py**:  
  This file contains the configuration settings for the app, including the secret key for session management and the database URI for connecting to the `SQLite` database.

- **forms.py**:  
  Contains the `Flask-WTF` forms used for user login, adding questions, and handling other form submissions. These forms enforce validation on the data submitted by users, ensuring clean and secure input.

- **helpers.py**:  
  This file contains utility functions such as grading the exam and generating the questions randomly for each exam session.

- **models.py**:  
  Defines the database schema using SQLAlchemy models. It contains the `User`, `Question`, and `ExamResult` classes that map to their respective database tables. Relationships between users and their results are also managed here.

- **templates/**:  
  This folder contains all the HTML files for rendering the web pages of the application. The main templates include:
   - `login.html`: Login page for users.
   - `register.html`: Registration page for new users.
   - `dashboard.html`: Dashboard for students to access their exams.
   - `admin_dashboard.html`: Special dashboard for examiners to manage questions and view results.
   - `exam.html`: Page where users take the exam.
   - `view_results.html`: Displays the exam results for students.
   - `admin_view_results.html`: Allows examiners to see the results of all students.

- **static/**:  
  This directory contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript that are used to style and add functionality to the HTML pages. The `style.css` file enhances the user interface, making the platform more visually appealing.

### Design Choices:

One of the key design decisions was the implementation of the examiner registration process. By introducing a secret password (`examiner@123`), we added an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized users from gaining administrative privileges. This password-based protection ensures that only those who know the correct password can register as examiners and manage exam content.

We also debated between allowing manual entry of exam questions versus bulk upload via CSV. Ultimately, both options were provided. For small-scale tests, examiners can add questions individually through the form. For larger tests, the CSV upload feature allows examiners to prepare the exam content more efficiently.

The project structure adheres to the Flask best practices by separating the configuration (`config.py`), database models (`models.py`), forms (`forms.py`), and templates (`templates/`). This modular approach makes the system maintainable and scalable for future improvements.

### Design Challenges:

1. **Database Integrity**: Ensuring that the data in the database is clean and accurate was a priority. We added validation checks in both the form submissions and the CSV upload process to prevent malformed or incomplete data from being stored.
   
2. **Security**: Security was another important consideration. Aside from the secret password for examiners, we implemented session management using `Flask-Login` to ensure that only authenticated users could access sensitive pages. Moreover, the forms use CSRF protection to safeguard against attacks.

3. **User Experience (UX)**: Since the platform is likely to be used by non-technical users, special attention was paid to the user interface. The styling was designed to be intuitive, with clear instructions and feedback messages for each action, such as successful registration, invalid login, or failed file uploads.

### Future Improvements:

- **Timer for Exams**: Implementing a countdown timer for exams could add a more structured testing experience for students.
  
- **Detailed Analytics**: Although examiners can currently view basic results, more detailed analytics (e.g., question-by-question performance, overall difficulty levels) could be introduced for deeper insights.

- **Question Categories**: Currently, all questions are pooled together for exam generation. In the future, we could allow examiners to categorize questions by subject or difficulty level and create exams based on these categories.
